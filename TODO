TODO list
=========
Note: Choose whatever you want and write a name next to it. The documentation should be team work, so after any implementing something important (like radiosity) write it down to the documentation
 * radiosity renderer
   * refactoring radiosity to implement via OpenCL (paralel design)
   * radiosity computed via OpenCL (implementation)
   * do some experiments to reach up the best paralelism/performance
 * documentation
