TODO list
=========
Note: Choose whatever you want and write a name next to it. The documentation should be team work, so after any implementing something important (like radiosity) write it down to the documentation
 * model improvements
   * add more object
 * default renderer
   * implement at least lambert lighting model
 * radiosity renderer
   * radiosity renderer in general
   * refactoring radiosity to implement via OpenCL (design)
   * radiosity computed via OpenCL (implementation)
   * do some experiments to reach up the best paralelism/performance
 * documentation
 * testing
   * build && run - linux
   * build && run - windows
 * gui
   * allow to turn light on/off independently
